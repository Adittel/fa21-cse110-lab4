1. values added: 20
2. final result:  20
3. this prints out 20
4. we get an error because result is not in the scope due to let
5. we try to assignment to constant variable so its an error
6. line 9 doesnt run so this line doesnt either due to same error

part 2
1. 3 is printed since that is the final value of i (3 elements in array)
2. 150 is retunred since that is the last value of discouted price (300*.5)
3. 150 is returned since that is the last value of final price (300*.5) rounded
4. [ 50, 100, 150 ] is returned since this is the array that contains all the pushed vals
5. we get an error saying that i is not defined since it is not in the scope of the overall block
6. we get an error saying that discounted price is not defined since it is not in the scope of the overall block
7. 150 is returned since that is the last value of final price (300*.5) rounded (its in the block)
8. [ 50, 100, 150 ] since the variable is in the overall block
9. we get an error saying that i is not defined since it is not in the scope of the overall block
10. 3 is the value 
11. [ 50, 100, 150 ] since this works
